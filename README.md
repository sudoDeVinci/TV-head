# TV Head

## What it is

This is the software behind my Tv Head cosplay made for NÃ¤rcon Summer 2023 using WS2812B LED strips as a dot matrix display to show various animations and images on the face.

While I had wanted to do this cosplay for a while, the technical details were modified from [Vivian Thomas'](https://rose.systems) implementation found [here](https://rose.systems/tv_head/).

My implementation aims more to be an alternate version of their mk1 design:
<br></br>
<img src='media/vivan.jpg' alt="MarineGEO circle logo" style="height: 300px; width:300px;"/>
<br></br>
- Rather than use diagonal strips, simply using thinner strips.
- Making the design more user serviceable and beginner friendly by:
  - Including fewer parts
  - Including a version written in MicroPython.
- Display pre-loaded images and animations, rather than text.
- Adjusting settings via knobs on the front of the face rather than a wired keyboard.
